    <h2>Why Am I Having Trouble Breathing?</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Experiencing breathing difficulty describes discomfort when breathing and feeling as if you can’t draw a complete breath. This can develop gradually or come on suddenly. Mild breathing problems, such as fatigue after an aerobics class, don’t fall into this category.</p>

    <p>Breathing difficulties can be caused by many different conditions. They can also develop as a result of stress and anxiety.
    </p>

    <p>It’s important to note that frequent episodes of shortness of breath or sudden, intense breathing difficulty may be signs of a serious health issue that needs medical attention. You should discuss any breathing concerns with your doctor.
    </p>
<h2>Lung conditions that can cause breathing difficulty</h2>

<p>There are a number of lung conditions that can cause you to experience difficulty breathing. Many of these require immediate medical attention.
</p>

<h4>Asthma
</h4>

<p>Asthma is an inflammation and narrowing of the airways that can cause:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>shortness of breath
    </li>
    <li>wheezing
    </li>
    <li>chest tightness
    </li>
    <li>coughing
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Asthma is a common condition that can range in severity.
</p>

<4>Pneumonia
</4>
<p>Pneumonia is a lung infection that can cause inflammation and a buildup of fluid and pus in the lung. Most types are contagious. Pneumonia can be a life-threatening condition, so prompt treatment is important.
</p>


<p>Symptoms may include</p>

<ul>
    <li>shortness of breath
    </li>
    <li>cough</li>
    <li>chest pain
</li>
    <li>chills</li>
    <li>sweating</li>
    <li>fever</li>
    <li>muscle pain</li>
    <li>exhaustion</li>
</ul>




<!--  Fever  -->



<h2>Everything You Need to Know About Fever</h2>


<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Fever is also known as hyperthermia, pyrexia, or elevated temperature. It describes a body temperature that’s higher than normal. Fever can affect children and adults.</p>


<p>A short-term increase in body temperature can help your body fight off illness. However, a severe fever can be a symptom of a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.
</p>

<h4>What to look for</h4>

<p>Recognizing a fever can enable you to get treatment and proper monitoring for it. Normal body temperature is typically around 98.6°F (37°C). However, the normal body temperature for each person can vary slightly.</p>



<p>Normal body temperature may also fluctuate depending on the time of day. It tends to be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.
</p>


<p>Other factors, such as your menstrual cycle or intense exercise, can also affect body temperature.
</p>


<p>To check you or your child’s temperature, you can use an oral, rectal, or axillary thermometer.</p>


<p>An oral thermometer should be placed under the tongue for three minutes.
</p>


<p>You may also use an oral thermometer for an axillary, or armpit, reading. Simply place the thermometer in the armpit and cross your arms or your child’s arms over the chest. Wait four to five minutes before removing the thermometer.
</p>


<p>A rectal thermometer may be used for measuring body temperature in infants. To do this:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Place a small amount of petroleum jelly on the bulb.
    </li>
    <li>Lay your baby on their stomach and gently insert the thermometer about 1 inch into their rectum.
    </li>
    <li>Hold the bulb and your baby still for at least three minutes.
    </li>
</ol>


<p>In general, a baby has a fever when their body temperature exceeds 100.4°F (38°C). A child has a fever when their temperature exceeds 99.5°F (37.5°C). An adult has a fever when their temperature exceeds 99–99.5°F (37.2–37.5°C).
</p>

<h4>What usually causes a fever?
</h4>

<p>Fever occurs when a part of the brain called the hypothalamus shifts the set point of your normal body temperature upward. When this happens, you may feel chilled and add layers of clothing, or you may start shivering to generate more body heat. This eventually results in a higher body temperature.
</p>



<p>There are numerous different conditions that can trigger a fever. Some possible causes include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>infections, including the flu and pneumonia
    </li>
    <li>some immunizations, such as diphtheria or tetanus (in children)</li>
    <li>teething (in infants)
    </li>
    <li>some inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn’s disease</li>
    <li>blood clots
    </li>
    <li>extreme sunburn
    </li>
    <li>food poisoning
    </li>
    <li>some medications, including antibiotics</li>
</ul>






<!--  Cough  -->


<h2>What Does My Type of Cough Mean?</h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Coughing is your body’s way of getting rid of an irritant. When something irritates your throat or airway, your nervous system sends an alert to your brain. Your brain responds by telling the muscles in your chest and abdomen to contract and expel a burst of air.
</p>

<p>A cough is an important defensive reflex that helps protect your body from irritants like mucus, smoke, and allergens such as dust, mold, and pollen.
</p>

<p>Coughing is a symptom of many illnesses and conditions. Sometimes, the characteristics of your cough can give you a clue to its cause.
</p>

<p>Coughs can be described by:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Behavior or experience. When and why does the cough happen? Is it at night, after eating, while exercising?
    </li>
    <li>Characteristics. How does your cough sound or feel? Hacking, wet, dry?</li>
    <li>Duration. Does your cough last less than two weeks, six weeks, more than eight weeks?
    </li>
    <li>Effects. Does your cough cause related symptoms such as urinary incontinence, vomiting, or sleeplessness?
    </li>
    <li>Grade. How bad is it? Is it annoying, persistent, or debilitating?</li>
    
</ul>

<p>Occasionally, your cough reflex is triggered by an obstruction in your airway. If you or your child has ingested something that could be blocking the airway, seek immediate medical attention. Signs of choking include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>bluish skin
    </li>
    <li>loss of consciousness
    </li>
    <li>inability to speak or cry
    </li>
    <li>wheezing, whistling, or other odd breathing noises
    </li>
    <li>weak or ineffective cough</li>
    <li>panic</li>
   
</ul>

<p>If you observe any of these signs, call 911 and perform the Heimlich maneuver or CPR.
</p>


<h4>Wet cough
</h4>
<p>
    A wet cough, also called a productive cough, is a cough that typically brings up mucus. Wet coughs are commonly caused by a cold or the flu. They can come on slowly or quickly and may be accompanied by other symptoms, such as:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>runny nose</li>
    <li>postnasal drip
    </li>
    <li>fatigue</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Wet coughs sound wet because your body is pushing mucus out of your respiratory system, which includes your throat, nose, airways, and lungs.

</p>

<p>
    If you have a wet cough, you may feel like there’s something stuck or dripping at the back of your throat or in your chest. Some of your coughs will bring mucus into your mouth.

</p>



<p>
    Wet coughs can be acute and last less than three weeks, or chronic and last longer than 8 weeks in adults or 4 weeks in children. The duration of a cough may be a big clue as to its cause.

</p>

<p>
    Conditions that can cause a wet cough include:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>cold or flu
    </li>
    <li>pneumonia</li>
    <li>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema and chronic bronchitis
    </li>
    <li>acute bronchitis</li>
    <li>asthma
    </li>

</ul>



<p>Coughs in babies, toddlers, and children that last less than three weeks are almost always caused by a cold or flu.</p>



<!----      Fatigue   -->



<h2>Causes of Fatigue and How to Manage It
</h2>

<h4>Overview
</h4>


<p>Fatigue is a term used to describe an overall feeling of tiredness or lack of energy. It isn’t the same as simply feeling drowsy or sleepy. When you’re fatigued, you have no motivation and no energy. Being sleepy may be a symptom of fatigue, but it’s not the same thing.</p>



<p>Fatigue is a common symptom of many medical conditions that range in severity from mild to serious. It’s also a natural result of some lifestyle choices, such as lack of exercise or poor diet.
</p>

<p>If your fatigue doesn’t resolve with proper rest and nutrition, or you suspect it’s caused by an underlying physical or mental health condition, see your doctor. They can help diagnose the cause of your fatigue and work with you to treat it.
</p>



<h4>What causes fatigue?</h4>

<p>There are many potential causes of fatigue. They can be divided into three general categories:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>lifestyle factors
    </li>
    <li>physical health conditions
    </li>
    <li>mental health issues</li>
</ul>
    <h4>Lifestyle factors</h4>
    <p>If you’re experiencing fatigue, your activities and other lifestyle choices may be the root cause. For example, fatigue can result from:
    </p>
 <ul>
    <li>physical exertion</li>
    <li>lack of physical activity</li>
    <li>lack of sleep</li>
    <li>being overweight or obese</li>
    <li>periods of emotional stress</li>
    <li>boredom</li>
    <li>grief</li>
    <li>taking certain medications, such as antidepressants or sedatives</li>
    <li>using illicit drugs, such as cocaine
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Physical health conditions</h4>
<p>Many medical conditions can also cause fatigue. Examples include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>anemiaarthritis</li>
    <li>chronic fatigue syndrome</li>
    <li>infections, such as cold and flu
    </li>
    <li>liver disease</li>
</ul>



<!--     Shortness of Breath-->

<h2>What Does Shortness of Breath Feel Like?</h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>


<p>Shortness of breath, or feeling “winded,” can leave you struggling to draw a full breath. You might feel like you’ve just run at a sprint, climbed several flights of stairs, or taken an aerobics class. These sensations may be familiar if you exercise regularly — but outside the context of exercise, they can feel alarming.</p>

<h4>What does shortness of breath feel like?</h4></h4>
<p>When you’re short of breath, you might feel like you can’t get enough air into your lungs — and you can’t do it quickly enough. You may feel like you’re running short on oxygen. It can feel more difficult to inhale and exhale, and sometimes you might be compelled to draw a breath before you’ve even finished the last exhale.</p>

<p>Some symptoms that appear with shortness of breath include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        a tight sensation in your chest

    </li>
    <li>feeling like you need to breathe more or more quickly
    </li>

    <li>feeling like your body can’t get enough oxygen quickly enough
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You might notice yourself becoming increasingly short of breath over a long period of time, or it could happen out of the blue. Sometimes, it can even strike while you’re at rest, such as when you’re sitting at your desk at work. Prolonged sitting can cause shortness of breath by way of bad posture.
</p>


<h4>What causes shortness of breath?
</h4>
<p>Sometimes, having knots in your muscles, especially on trigger points, can make you feel short of breath.
</p>

<p>Anxiety — whether acute and situational or a chronic disorder — can also cause you to feel short of breath. Anxiety or panic attacks can sometimes be mistaken for a heart attack. But you don’t have to experience a full-blown attack to feel short of breath. Low-level anxiety can cause this, too.
</p>

<p>Shortness of breath can often occur due to outside circumstances, such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>high altitudes
    </li>
    <li>poor air quality, such as that due to carbon monoxide or smog
    </li>
    <li>temperature extremes
    </li>
    <li>strenuous exercise
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    But there are medical conditions that can cause shortness of breath, both acute and chronic, such as:

</p>
<ul>

    <li>allergies</li>
    <li>asthma
    </li>
    <li>congestive heart failure
    </li>
    <li>heart arrhythmia or heart attack</li>
</ul>



<!--      Runny Nose      -->

<h2>15 Causes of a Runny Nose</h2>

<p>A runny nose is a symptom of many conditions. It’s characterized by mucus draining or dripping from the nostril.
</p>



<p>Mucus is a protective substance produced by the mucous membrane, a type of tissue lining the nasal cavity. Mucus moistens the air you breathe, and it acts as a barrier to keep dust, pollen, and bacteria out of your lungs.
</p>

<p>Your nose produces mucus every day, yet you probably don’t notice because it mixes with saliva and drips down the back of your throat.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, irritation or inflammation in the nasal passage can lead to increased mucus production. When this happens, excess mucus can drain or drip from the nose.
</p>

<p>Here’s a look at 15 common causes of a runny nose.
</p>



<ul>
    <li>Allergies</li>
    <li>Common cold</li>
    <li>Sinusitis</li>
    <li>Deviated septum
    </li>
    <li>Flu</li>
    <li>Medication</li>
    <li>Nonallergic rhinitis</li>
    <li>Hormonal changes
    </li>
    <li>Dry air
    </li>
    <li>Nasal polyps
    </li>
    <li>Nasal spray overuse
    </li>
    <li>Respiratory syncytial virus</li>
    <li>Spicy foods</li>
    <li>Smoke
    </li>
    <li>Pregnancy
    </li>
    
</ul>

<h2>What Causes a Stuffy Nose?</h2>

<h4>Nasal congestion
</h4>


<p>Nasal congestion, also called a stuffy nose, is often a symptom of another health problem such as a sinus infection. It may also be caused by the common cold.
</p>

<p>Nasal congestion is marked by:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>a stuffy or runny nose</li>
    <li>sinus pain</li>
    <li>mucus buildup</li>
    <li>swollen nasal tissue</li>

</ul>
<p>Home remedies may be enough to alleviate nasal congestion, particularly if it’s caused by the common cold. However, if you experience long-term congestion, you may need medical treatment.
</p>


<h4>Causes of nasal congestion
</h4>

<p>Congestion is when your nose becomes stuffed up and inflamed. Minor illnesses are the most common causes of nasal congestion. For instance, a cold, the flu, and sinus infections can all cause stuffy noses. Illness-related congestion usually improves within one week.
</p>
<p>If it lasts longer than one week, it’s often a symptom of an underlying health issue. Some explanations for long-term nasal congestion may be:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>allergies
    </li>
    <li>hay fever
    </li>
    <li>noncancerous growths, called nasal polyps, or benign tumors in the nasal passages
    </li>
    <li>chemical exposures
    </li>
    <li>environmental irritants
    </li>
    <li>a long-lasting sinus infection, known as chronic sinusitis
    </li>
    <li>a deviated septum
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Nasal congestion may also occur during pregnancy, usually during the end of the first trimester. Hormonal fluctuations and increased blood supply that occur during pregnancy may cause this nasal congestion.
</p>
<p>hese changes may affect the nasal membranes, causing them to become inflamed, dry, or to bleed.
</p>




<!---   Sore Throat   -->


<h2>What is a sore throat?
</h2>
<p>A sore throat is a painful, dry, or scratchy feeling in the throat</p>

<p>Most sore throats are caused by infections, or by environmental factors like dry air. Although a sore throat can be uncomfortable, it’ll usually go away on its own.
</p>



<p>Sore throats are divided into types, based on the part of the throat they affect:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Pharyngitis affects the area right behind the mouth.
    </li>
    <li>Tonsillitis is swelling and redness of the tonsils, the soft tissue in the back of the mouth.
    </li>
    <li>Laryngitis is swelling and redness of the voice box, or larynx.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Sore throat symptoms
</h4>

<p>The symptoms of a sore throat can vary depending on what caused it. A sore throat can feel:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>scratchy</li>
    <li>burning</li>
    <li>raw</li>
    <li>dry</li>
    <li>tender</li>
    <li>irritated</li>
</ul>

<p>It may hurt more when you swallow or talk. Your throat or tonsils might also look red.
</p>

<p>Sometimes, white patches or areas of pus will form on the tonsils. These white patches are more common in strep throat than in a sore throat caused by a virus.
</p>



<!--  Why Does My Body Ache?  -->




<h2>Why Does My Body Ache?
</h2>

<h4>Is this cause for concern?
</h4>

<p>Body aches are a common symptom of many conditions. The flu is one of the most well-known conditions that can cause body aches. Aches can also be caused by your everyday life, especially if you stand, walk, or exercise for long periods of time.</p>

<p>You may just need rest and some treatment at home to relieve your body aches. But some aches, especially ones that last a long time, may mean that you have an underlying condition. In these cases, you may need to see your doctor for a diagnosis. They can create a long-term treatment plan to can relieve your aches and other associated symptoms.
</p>

<p>Keep reading to learn more about what may be causing your symptoms.
</p>

<h4>Stress
</h4>
<p>When you’re stressed out, your immune system can’t control its response to inflammation as well. As a result, your body can’t fight off infections or sickness as well as it usually can. This can cause your body to ache as it becomes more susceptible to inflammation and infection throughout your body.
</p>

<p>Watch out for other symptoms of stress and anxiety, such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>abnormally high heart rate</li>
    <li>increased blood pressure
    </li>
    <li>hot flashes or cold sweats
    </li>
    <li>hyperventilating
    </li>
    <li>abnormal physical shaking
    </li>
    <li>headaches, such as tension headaches or migraines
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you think stress is causing your body aches, make small changes to your daily lifestyle to reduce your stress as much as possible. Try these steps:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Meditate for a few minutes per day. Focus on your breathing and take your mind off the people or events causing you stress.
    </li>
    <li>Take a walk or leave a stressful environment to remove yourself from triggers.
    </li>
    <li>Share your feelings of stress with someone you trust to help articulate the cause of your stress.</li>
    <li>If you’re losing sleep over stress, try relaxation techniques before bed or take short naps throughout the day to refresh yourself.
    </li>


</ul>


<h4>Dehydration
</h4>
<p>Water is an essential ingredient for your body’s normal and healthy functioning. Without it, your body can’t properly perform many of its important processes, including breathing and digestion. When you become dehydrated and these processes don’t work well, you can feel physical pain as a result.
</p>

<p>Other symptoms of dehydration include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>dark urine
    </li>
    <li>dizziness or disorientation
    </li>
    <li>exhaustion
    </li>
    <li>extreme thirst
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t drink enough water, especially on a hot or dry day, you can become dehydrated quickly. You should aim to drink about eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day, plus more if you’re physically active and sweating.
</p>

<p>If you’re dehydrated because of a condition like diarrhea, drink plenty of water until the episode passes. Drinking water or beverages with extra electrolytes can help keep you hydrated and replace the electrolytes lost to diarrhea, too.</p>

<p>If you can’t keep water down, see your doctor right away or seek emergency medical help to make sure you don't become severely dehydrated.
</p>


<h4>Lack of sleep</h4>
<p>Not getting enough sleep can impact your overall health. You need at least 6 to 8 hours of sleep every night, including the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Your body’s tissues and cells need proper sleep to stay healthy, and your brain needs it to stay refreshed and alert. Without it, your body doesn’t have the time to rest and replenish essential energies and processes. This can lead to pain.
</p>

<p>Other symptoms of sleep deprivation include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>confusion or disorientation
    </li>
    <li>falling asleep during the day without realizing it
    </li>
    <li>trouble understanding when reading or listening to others
    </li>
    <li>trouble speaking properly
    </li>
    <li>trouble remembering things
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Try to establish a consistent sleep schedule every night. Your body needs to follow a daily rhythm, or circadian rhythm, to stay healthy.
</p>


<ul>
    <li>drinking hot tea or other hot beverage
    </li>
    <li>meditating</li>
    <li>listening to music or a podcast
    </li>
    <li>having white noise in the room, such as from a fan
    </li>

</ul>

<h4>Cold or flu</h4>
<p>A cold and the flu are both viral infections that cause inflammation. These infections attack your body, and your immune system attempts to fight them off. Inflammation, especially in your throat, chest, and lungs, can be painful. The rest of your body might ache, too, as your body works hard to fight the infection.
</p>
<p>Other common symptoms of a cold or flu include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>sore throat</li>
    <li>hoarse voice
    </li>
    <li>sneezing or coughing
    </li>
    <li>thick, colored mucus</li>
    <li>headaches or earaches
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Getting rest, drinking plenty of water, and gargling with warm salt water to ease your throat pain can help your body get over a cold or the flu quickly. Over-the-counter medications, such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) and ibuprofen (Advil), can help relieve your symptoms and aches.
</p>
