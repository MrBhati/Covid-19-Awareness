  <!-- Home self isolation  -->

  <h2>How to self-isolate at home when you may have been exposed and have no symptoms</h2>

  <h4>Limit contact with others</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Stay at home or the place you are staying in your place.</li>
    <li>Do not go to school, work, other public areas or use public transportation (e.g., buses, taxis).</li>
    <li>Do not have visitors.</li>
    <li>Avoid contact with older adults, or those with medical conditions, who are at a higher risk of developing
      serious illness.</li>
    <li>Avoid contact with others, especially those who have not travelled or been exposed to the virus.</li>
    <li>If contact cannot be avoided, take the following precautions:
      <ul>
        <li>keep at least 2 metres between yourself and the other person</li>
        <li>keep interactions brief</li>
        <li>stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom, if possible</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Keep your hands clean</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Wash your hands <b>often</b> with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and dry with disposable paper towels
      or dry reusable towel, replacing it when it becomes wet.</li>
    <li>You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
    <li>Cough or sneeze into the bend of your arm or into a tissue.</li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Keep surfaces clean and avoid sharing personal items</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch often, like toilets, bedside tables, doorknobs,
      phones and television remotes.</li>
    <li>Use store-bought disinfectants to clean, following the directions on the label.</li>
    <li>Do not share personal items with others, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic
      devices.</li>
  </ul>



  <h4>Monitor yourself for symptoms</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Monitor yourself for symptoms, particularly fever and respiratory symptoms such as coughing or difficulty
      breathing.</li>
    <li>Take and record your temperature daily (or as directed by your public health authority) and avoid using
      fever-reducing medications (e.g. acetaminophen, ibuprofen) as much as possible. These medications could mask an
      early symptom of COVID-19.</li>
    <li>If you develop symptoms, even if mild:
      <ul>
        <li>
          stay home
        </li>
        <li>
          immediately isolate yourself from others in your house
        </li>
        <li>
          contact your public health authority as soon as possible and follow their instructions
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Supplies to have at home when self-isolating</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Disposable paper towels</li>
    <li>Thermometer</li>
    <li>Running water</li>
    <li>Hand soap</li>
    <li>Alcohol-based sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol</li>
    <li>Dish soap</li>
    <li>Regular laundry soap</li>
    <li>Regular household cleaning products</li>
    <li>Alcohol prep wipes</li>
    <li>Arrange to have your groceries delivered to you</li>
  </ul>


  <!--Social distancing-->



  <h2>Social distancing</h2>
  <p>Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each
    other. Social distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an
    outbreak. With patience and cooperation, we can all do our part.</p>




  <h4>What does Social Distancing mean?</h4>
  <p>This means making changes in your everyday routines in order to minimize close contact with others, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings</li>
    <li>avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes</li>
    <li>limiting contact with people at higher risk (e.g. older adults and those in poor health)</li>
    <li>keeping a distance of at least 2 arms lengths (approximately 2 metres) from others, as much as possible</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>
    Here’s how you can practice social distancing:
  </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>greet with a wave instead of a handshake, a kiss or a hug</li>
    <li>stay home as much as possible, including for meals and entertainment</li>
    <li>shop or take public transportation during off-peak hours</li>
    <li>conduct virtual meetings</li>
    <li>host virtual playdates for your kids</li>
    <li>use technology to keep in touch with friends and family</li>
    <h4>If possible,</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>use food delivery services or online shopping</li>
      <li>exercise at home or outside</li>
      <li>work from home</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h4>Remember to:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your face</li>
    <li>cough or sneeze into the bend of your arm</li>
    <li>avoid touching surfaces people touch often</li>
  </ul>


  <h4>If you’re concerned you may have COVID-19:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>separate yourself from others as soon as you have symptoms</li>
    <li>if you are outside the home when a symptom develops, go home immediately and avoid taking public transit</li>
    <li>stay home and follow the advice of your Public Health Authority, who may recommend self-isolation</li>
    <li>call ahead to a health care provider if you are ill and seeking medical attention</li>
  </ul>

  

<!--  Wash your hands  -->

<h2>Wash your hands</h2>
<ol ></ol>
  <li >Wet hands with warm water.</li>
  <li>Apply soap.</li>
  <li>Wash hands for at least 20 seconds (including your palms, back of each hand, between fingers, thumbs and under nails).</li>
  <li>Rinse well.</li>
  <li>Dry hands well with paper towel.</li>
  <li>Turn off tap using paper towel.</li>
</ol>





<!--    Cleaning and disinfecting public spaces    -->


<h2>Cleaning and disinfecting public spaces</h2>
<p>
  This document provides guidance on cleaning and disinfecting of public settings, including schools, universities, public libraries, museums, public transit, communal residences and workplaces.
</p>

<h4>What you should know</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Surfaces frequently touched with hands are most likely to be contaminated. These include doorknobs, handrails, elevator buttons, light switches, cabinet handles, faucet handles, tables, countertops and electronics.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is not yet known how long the virus causing COVID-19 lives on surfaces, however, early evidence suggests it can live on objects and surfaces from a few hours to days.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Choose a product that cleans and disinfects</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    When cleaning public spaces, choose products that clean and disinfect all at once (e.g. premixed store-bought disinfectant cleaning solutions and/or wipes when available).
  <ul>
    <li>
      Cleaning products remove germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces by using soap (or detergent) and water. Cleaning does not necessarily kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection.
    </li>

    <li>
      Disinfecting products kill germs on surfaces using chemicals.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>

</ul>

<h4>Create a cleaning procedure</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Operators of community settings should develop or review protocols and procedures for cleaning public spaces. This will help determine where improvements or additional cleaning may be needed.</li>
  <li>Read and follow manufacturer's instructions for safe use of cleaning and disinfection products (e.g. wear gloves, use in well-ventilated area, allow enough contact time for disinfectant to kill germs based on the product being used).</li>
  <li>Wash hands with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer after removing gloves.</li>
  <li>Use damp cleaning methods such as damp clean cloths, and/or a wet mop. Do not dust or sweep which can distribute virus droplets into the air.</li>
  <li>Contaminated disposable cleaning items (e.g. mop heads, cloths) should be placed in a lined garbage bin before disposing of them with regular waste. Reusable cleaning items can be washed using regular laundry soap and hot water (60-90°C). Clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch often.</li>
  <li>In addition to routine cleaning, surfaces that are frequently touched with hands should be cleaned and disinfected more often, as well as when visibly dirty.</li>
  <li>Shared spaces such as kitchens and bathrooms should also be cleaned more often.</li>
</ul>



<!--   People who are at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19 -->

<h2>People who are at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19</h2>
<p>While diseases can make anyone sick, some Canadians are more  at risk of developing severe complications from an illness due to underlying  medical conditions and age. If you are at risk for complications, you can take  action to reduce your risk of getting sick from COVID-19. </p>

<h4>Who is at high risk?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>People with medical conditions including:
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>People with weakened immune systems from a  medical condition or treatment, such as chemotherapy</li>
  <li>Older adults</li>
</ul>


<h4>Be prepared</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Stock up on the supplies you would need if you were  to have to stay home for a few weeks, such as groceries, pet food and cleaning  products</li>
  <li>Talk with your health care provider about how to  protect yourself and ensure you have enough of your prescribed medications and  medical supplies</li>
  <li>Prepare to stay connected with others by phone  or email</li>
  <li>Identify who you can ask for support with  chores, home maintenance and errands if you get sick</li>
  <li>Identify which services are available to deliver  food or medications to your home</li>
  <li>Monitor yourself for symptoms</li>
</ul>


<h4>How to reduce your risk of COVID-19</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If possible, stay home while there is a COVID-19  outbreak in your community and limit the number of visitors to your home</li>
  <li>Clean hands frequently with soap and water for  at least 20 seconds or, if not available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li>
  <li>Carry alcohol-based hand sanitizer when you are  outside of your home</li>
  <li>Frequently clean and disinfect high-touch  surfaces in your environment with regular household cleaners</li>
  <li>Clean touch screens with 70% alcohol wipes</li>
  <li>Avoid touching your mouth, nose, and eyes and/or  food with your hands</li>
  <li>Avoid touching high-touch surfaces such as  doorknobs, handrails and elevator buttons in public places</li>
  <li>If you need to touch surfaces in public places,  use a tissue or your sleeve to cover your hand</li>
  <li>Give a friendly wave or elbow bump instead of a  handshake, kiss or hug</li>
  <li>Stay away from people who are sick</li>
  <li>Remind others who are sick, or may have been  exposed to the virus, to stay away</li>
  <li>Change your routine to avoid crowded places,  such as grocery shopping at off-peak hours, commuting by public transit outside  of rush hour and exercising outdoors instead of in an indoor fitness centre</li>
  <li>Avoid crowds and large gatherings</li>
  <li>Increase social distance with others to two arm  lengths (or approximately two metres)</li>
</ul>

<h4>What to do if you get a symptom of COVID-19</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Symptoms of COVID-19 include:
    <ul>
      <li>a new cough or a chronic cough that gets worse,  or </li>
      <li>a fever (greater or equal to 38⁰C  or signs of a fever like shivering, flushed skin, excessive sweating), or</li>
      <li>difficulty breathing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you develop a symptom, stay home and call  your health care provider or local public health unit and tell them about your  symptoms</li>
  <li>Always call ahead before going to see a health  provider or health care facility so that they can keep others from being exposed</li>
  <li>The following symptoms should be considered  urgent
    <ul>
      <li>significant  difficulty breathing (e.g., can’t catch breath, gasping) </li>
      <li>chest  pain or pressure </li>
      <li>new  confusion or difficulty waking up</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you develop these urgent symptoms, call 911  and inform them that you may have COVID-19 and are at high risk for  complications.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How to self-isolate at home when you may have been exposed and have no symptoms</h2>




<h2>Take steps to protect others</h2>
<h4>
  Stay home if you’re sick
</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>
  <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.
  </li>
  <li>Throw used tissues in the trash.
  </li>
  <li>Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>
  Wear a facemask if you are sick

</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.
  </li>
  <li>If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.
  </li>

</ul>


<h4>
  Clean and disinfect

</h4>
<ul>
  <li>lean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
  </li>
  <li>If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
  </li>
</ul>




<!---Testing Your self:     -->
<h2> Testing Your self:</h2>
<h4> 
  Testing for COVID-19
</h4>

<p>There are laboratory tests that can identify the virus that causes COVID-19 in respiratory specimens. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. All of these tests are Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panels, that can provide results in 4 to 6 hours.
</p>
<h4>Who should be tested
</h4>
<p>Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. Here is some information that might help in making decisions about seeking care or testing.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home.
  </li>
  <li>There is no treatment specifically approved for this virus.
  </li>
  <li>Testing results may be helpful to inform decision-making about who you come in contact with.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health departments and/or individual clinicians.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clinicians should work with their state and local health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories, or work with clinical or commercial laboratories.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>
  How to get tested

</h4>

<p>
  If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, try calling your state or local health department or a medical provider. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested.

</p>

<h4>What to do after you are tested
</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If you test positive for COVID-19, see If You Are Sick or Caring for Someone.
  </li>
  <li>If you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your specimen was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. It is possible that you were very early in your infection at the time of your specimen collection and that you could test positive later, or you could be exposed later and then develop illness. In other words, a negative test result does not rule out getting sick later.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>CDC expects that widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States will occur. In the coming months, most of the U.S. population will be exposed to this virus. You should continue to practice all the protective measures recommended to keep yourself and others free from illness. See How to Protect Yourself.
</p>




<!---  Clinical care: 
   -->
<h4>
  Clinical Presentation

</h4>

<p>Among reports that describe the clinical presentation of patients with confirmed COVID-19, most are limited to hospitalized patients with pneumonia. The incubation period is estimated at 4 days (interquartile range: 2 to 7 days). [1] Some studies have estimated a wider range for the incubation period; data for human infection with other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2-14 days. Frequently reported signs and symptoms of patients admitted to the hospital include fever (77–98%), cough (46%–82%), myalgia or fatigue (11–52%), and shortness of breath (3-31%) at illness onset.</p>


<h4>Clinical Course
</h4>

<p>Clinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic infection to mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.</p>

<h4>Clinical Course</h4>
<p>Clinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic infection to mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.</p>

<p>An overall case fatality proportion of 2.3% has been reported among confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China. However, the majority of these cases were among hospitalized patients and therefore this estimate of mortality is likely biased upward. Among hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the case fatality proportion has been reported as 4–15%. Among critically ill COVID-19 patients in China, the reported case fatality proportion was 49%. In a report from one hospital, 61.5% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 had died by day 28 of ICU admission.
</p>


<h4>Diagnostic Testing</h4>
<p>Information on specimen collection, handling, and storage is available at: Real-Time RT-PCR Panel for Detection 2019-Novel Coronavirus. After initial confirmation of COVID-10, additional testing of clinical specimens can help inform clinical management, including discharge planning.
</p>

<h4>Laboratory and Radiographic Findings</h4>

<p>The most common laboratory abnormalities reported among hospitalized patients with pneumonia on admission included leukopenia (9–25%), leukocytosis (24–30%), lymphopenia (63%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (37%). </p>
<p>Among 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymphocytopenia was present in 83%; 36% had thrombocytopenia, and 34% had leukopenia. [6] Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission. Chest CT images have shown bilateral involvement in most patients. Multiple areas of consolidation and ground glass opacities are typical findings reported to date.</p>
<p>However, one study that evaluated the time from symptom onset to initial CT scan found that 56% of patients who presented within 2 days had a normal CT. </p>


<h4>Clinical Management and Treatment
</h4>
<p>Patients with a mild clinical presentation may not initially require hospitalization. However, clinical signs and symptoms may worsen with progression to lower respiratory tract disease in the second week of illness; all patients should be monitored closely. Possible risk factors for progressing to severe illness may include, but are not limited to, older age, and underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, and pregnancy.
</p>

<p>The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient’s ability to engage in monitoring, home isolation, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment. For more information, see Evaluating and Reporting Persons Under Investigation (PUI)
